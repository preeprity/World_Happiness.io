                    The first World Happiness Report was published in April, 2012, in support of the UN High Level Meeting on happiness and well-being. Since then the world has come a long way. Increasingly, happiness is considered to be the proper measure of social progress and the goal of public policy.

                    In February 2017, the United Arab Emirates held a full-day World Happiness meeting, as part of the World Government Summit. Then on World Happiness Day, March 20th,<a href ="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2017/"> The World Happiness Report 2017 </a> was released at the United Nations, again published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

                    The rankings of national happiness are based on a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness#Measurement" >Cantril ladder </a> survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the results with various life factors.

                    In this Visualization, I have taken the Happiness_2017 dataset <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness">from Kaggle.com </a> and displayed it with different visualisations.
                    Every visualisation is created with the goal of adding a different perspective and give more insight to the data.
